# Minting SDKs (v2)

This will just be a collection of whatever language implementations of the **mintv2** method I "develop" (read: hack together)

These will not be thoroughly tested or production-ready, rather just a guide for other developers who are looking into implementing or ditching IMX-SDK for this specific method.
